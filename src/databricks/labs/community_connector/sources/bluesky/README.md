# Lakeflow Bluesky Community Connector

Ingest raw Bluesky and AT Protocol repository events from Jetstream's sealed
archive into a triggered Databricks Lakeflow pipeline. The source name is
`bluesky`; its only object is `events`.

## Prerequisites

- A Databricks workspace with Unity Catalog and Community Connectors enabled,
  plus permission to create a connection, pipeline, and destination table.
- Network access from the pipeline to a Jetstream v2 HTTPS archive.
- A Jetstream archive bearer key for the public hosted endpoint. A self-hosted
  archive may allow anonymous reads.
- A triggered pipeline. Continuous pipelines are not supported.

## Setup

### Required connection parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | string | No | Jetstream v2 HTTPS origin; defaults to `https://jetstream.us-east.bsky.network`. Keep the same origin for an existing checkpoint. | `https://jetstream.us-east.bsky.network` |
| `api_key` | secret string | For the public hosted archive | Raw bearer key used for archive HTTP access. A self-hosted anonymous archive may omit it. | Secret supplied through Unity Catalog |
| `externalOptionsAllowList` | comma-separated string | Yes, when creating the connection directly | Permits every Bluesky-specific table option listed below. The Community Connector UI/CLI can populate this from `connector_spec.yaml`. | Full list below |

The complete Bluesky-specific `externalOptionsAllowList` value is:

```text
starting_cursor,collections,kinds,dids,max_events_per_refresh,request_timeout_seconds,refresh_timeout_seconds,max_retries,include_raw_payload
```

The framework may also add its own standard pipeline option names. Do not
replace the generated allowlist with only a subset of the names above.

### Obtain the archive key

Create an archive access key with the operator of the Jetstream endpoint you
will read. Store it as a secret in the Unity Catalog connection; pass the raw
key without a `Bearer ` prefix. The key is never a table option. If you use an
anonymous self-hosted endpoint, omit it.

### Create a Unity Catalog connection

Use the Community Connector flow from **Add Data**, select Bluesky, and enter
the endpoint and key. You can also create a `COMMUNITY` connection with the
standard Unity Catalog API or the Community Connector CLI using
`connector_spec.yaml`, with `sourceName=bluesky`. When creating the connection
directly, include the full `externalOptionsAllowList` value above so pipeline
table options reach the source. Keep the key in the connection's secret field.

## Supported objects

| Object | Ingestion | Key and cursor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `events` | Append-only | `seq` | Includes commit create/update/delete, identity, account, and sync events. |

The `seq` value is an instance-local event identifier. `record` and
`event_payload` contain JSON text for flexible AT Protocol payloads;
`raw_payload` optionally contains the exact archived DAG-CBOR bytes. Repository
events are not hydrated Bluesky views: profiles, threads, and engagement
counts require separate AppView enrichment. Delete and account markers are
appended as rows rather than applied as Lakeflow CDC deletes.

## Table configurations

### Source and destination

| Option | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source_table` | Yes | Exactly `events`. |
| `destination_catalog` | No | Destination Unity Catalog catalog. |
| `destination_schema` | No | Destination schema. |
| `destination_table` | No | Destination table name; defaults to `events`. |

### Common `table_configuration` options

The pipeline's standard destination options (such as `primary_keys`,
`sequence_by`, and `cluster_by`) are consumed by Lakeflow. This source declares
append ingestion; configure the destination as `APPEND_ONLY` when supplying an
explicit `scd_type`.

### Bluesky-specific `table_configuration` options

All values are strings. Pydantic validates them before a read.

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `starting_cursor` | No | `0` | Exclusive sequence to use without a checkpoint. A zero start can take many refreshes to reach current data. |
| `collections` | No | all | Comma-separated collection NSIDs or namespace wildcards; applies to commits only. |
| `kinds` | No | all | Comma-separated subset of `commit`, `identity`, `account`, `sync`. Must include `commit` when using `collections`. |
| `dids` | No | all | Comma-separated repository DIDs. |
| `max_events_per_refresh` | No | `10000` | Maximum sequence span per update, from 1 to 100,000. Filtering can yield fewer rows. |
| `request_timeout_seconds` | No | `20` | Per-request timeout, from 1 to 120 seconds. |
| `refresh_timeout_seconds` | No | `120` | Planning/read budget, from 1 to 900 seconds. |
| `max_retries` | No | `3` | Additional attempts for transient HTTP failures, from 0 to 8. |
| `include_raw_payload` | No | `true` | `true` or `false`; retain exact event payload bytes. |

## Data type mapping

| Jetstream value | Databricks column/type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event sequence | `seq BIGINT` | Incremental cursor and event key. |
| Indexed/witness time | `event_time TIMESTAMP`, `witnessed_at TIMESTAMP` | Display and immutable witness timestamps in UTC. |
| Repository and event metadata | `did`, `kind`, `operation`, `collection`, `rkey`, `cid`, `rev` as `STRING` | Identity and commit metadata; some fields are null for non-commit events. |
| Resync kind | `is_resync BOOLEAN` | Marks a resync replacement create. |
| Decoded payload | `record STRING`, `event_payload STRING` | JSON text; `record` is null for deletes and non-commit events. |
| Encoded payload | `raw_payload BINARY` | Optional exact DAG-CBOR event payload. |

## How to run

1. Install this source wheel, the matching Lakeflow Community Connectors
   framework, and `jetstream-lakehouse==0.1.0` in a triggered pipeline. PySpark
   comes from the Databricks runtime.
2. Create the connection above and add `events` to your pipeline spec. For a
   narrow first run, select one collection and use a recent sealed sequence
   from the **same** endpoint as `starting_cursor`.

```json
{
  "connection_name": "bluesky_jetstream",
  "objects": [{"table": {
    "source_table": "events",
    "destination_catalog": "main",
    "destination_schema": "bluesky",
    "destination_table": "events",
    "table_configuration": {
      "scd_type": "APPEND_ONLY",
      "starting_cursor": "0",
      "collections": "app.bsky.feed.post"
    }
  }}]
}
```

3. Run a small update, inspect the table and checkpoint, then schedule further
   triggered updates. Preserve the checkpoint and endpoint. The standalone
   project includes a runnable [pipeline example](https://github.com/jesinity/lakeflow-connect-bluesky/blob/integration/jetstream-lakehouse/examples/ingest.py)
   and [SQL for current posts](https://github.com/jesinity/lakeflow-connect-bluesky/blob/integration/jetstream-lakehouse/examples/posts.sql).

### Best practices and troubleshooting

- Start with a small `max_events_per_refresh` and a recent sequence. Filters
  can produce an empty table update while still advancing the checkpoint.
- Archive compaction can remove earlier events before the first read. Successful
  replay is not proof of a complete historical audit log.
- If a pinned segment is compacted before a retry, the connector fails without
  advancing the checkpoint. Investigate the original generation; do not reset
  the checkpoint into an existing append table without reviewing duplicates.
- Authentication failures indicate a missing/invalid archive key. A timeout
  can be addressed by narrowing the sequence span or increasing the bounded
  request budget within the documented limits.
- This reads sealed segments, so it lags the live Jetstream socket. It does
  not offer a continuous firehose or automatic failover between origins.
